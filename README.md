# proxy-list

Proxies are checked on my VPS every 30 minutes using [proxy-scraper-checker](https://github.com/monosans/proxy-scraper-checker).

Every proxy's entry-node and exit-node are IPv4.

## Folders description

`proxies` - proxies with any anonymity level.

`proxies_anonymous` - anonymous proxies.

`proxies_geolocation` - same as `proxies`, but includes exit-node's geolocation.

`proxies_geolocation_anonymous` - same as `proxies_anonymous`, but includes exit-node's geolocation.

Geolocation format is ip:port::Country::Region::City.
